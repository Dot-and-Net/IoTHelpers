# IoT Helpers

Windows 10 IoT Core IoT Helpers
---------------------------------------------------------
This library allows to easily interact with GPIO, I2C and SPI in Windows 10 IoT Core with boards like Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, MinnowBoard Max and Toradex Colibri. It comes with a rich set of [samples](https://github.com/Dot-and-Net/IoTHelpers/Samples) that show how to use it in different scenarios.

**Installation**

The **IoTHelpers** library is available on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/IoTHelpers/). Just search *IoTHelpers* in the **Package Manager GUI** or run the following command in the **Package Manager Console**:

    Install-Package IoTHelpers

At this moment, the NuGet package contains the ARM version only, so if you want to use the library with MinnowBoard Max, you should fork the GitHub project and use the source code directly.

**Usage**

Refer to the [project documentation](https://github.com/Dot-and-Net/IoTHelpers/wiki/Home) to find examples about how to use this library. You can also find some code samples in the [Samples](https://github.com/Dot-and-Net/IoTHelpers/Samples) folder.
